# Banknotes Converter

Banknotes converter class with one fully working method. It takes value and converts them to minimum amount of banknote units needed.

First time I tried to test code outside laravel, so I found phpspec tool. 
Code is written using TDD, so first test, later code and refactoring.


### Installing and Running

Composer based installation

```
composer install
```

To check if tests works

```
bin/phpspec run -fpretty
```
